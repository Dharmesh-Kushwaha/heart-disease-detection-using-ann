This project implements a production-ready machine learning system for binary classification of heart disease risk using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The end-to-end pipeline ingests raw clinical and demographic patient data, applies rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, and trains a neural network model to predict the presence of heart disease.

The technical workflow begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying data distributions, correlations, and anomalies. Key steps include treating outliers in critical physiological markers like blood pressure and BMI using statistical winsorization, and encoding categorical variables for model compatibility. The core predictive model is a sequentially constructed ANN, built with TensorFlow and Keras, which leverages Dense layers with ReLU activation functions for feature learning and a sigmoid output for probabilistic classification. To ensure robustness and prevent overfitting, the training process incorporates Early Stopping callbacks and uses a standardized validation split.

The final artifact is a saved model and scaler, serialized for deployment, achieving a high level of predictive accuracy. This system demonstrates a complete ML lifecycle, from data wrangling and analysis to model training, evaluation, and persistence, forming a solid foundation for a clinical decision support tool.
